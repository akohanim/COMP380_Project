# Smart Grader

### Introduction

Smart Grader is a grade management program which provides teachers, professors and
educators alike, the ability to view, edit and modify student grades through an easy to
use graphical user interface (GUI).

An account is needed to create the users proile, which acts a the basis for the users
data. The account information is stored locally, so the user does not need internet con-
nection benefit from the program.

This program provides some of the powerful capabilities of spreadsheets with the ease
of use of a GUI. No prior spreadsheet knowledge or external spreadsheet program is
needed. With a few mouse clicks, users are able to modify grade books individually on
a per course basis.
